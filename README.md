# Electro-Actuated-Solenoid-Valve

### About

This project consists of an NC Solenoid Valve Spec controlled and actuated by a STM32 based controller to regulate propellant/fluid flow.

The aim for the valve is to implement the use of the valve to move and regulate variable propellant flow through plumbing systems.
