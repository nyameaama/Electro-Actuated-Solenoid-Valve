# Thrust Vectoring Control 

### About

This project is a description of a dual linear actuator enabled thrust vectoring sytem for an engine bell. The aim for the project is to determine the best way to enable precision control and a way for me to learn and gain experience dealing with control of actuators and the design of mechanical gimbals.
