# Electro-Actuated-Solenoid-Valve

### About

This project consists of an NC Solenoid Valve Spec controlled and actuated by a STM32 based controller to regulate propellant/fluid flow.

The aim for the valve is to implement the use of solenoid valve to move and regulate variable propellant flow through plumbing systems.

As solenoid valves are static controlled and cannot be open partially,


**Control Process**

Input :

- Input Flow Rate
- Valve Response time
- Desired output flow Rate

Output :

* Signal (Open, Close) + time (Duration of signal process)
